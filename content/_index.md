Computer Science undergraduate at University of São Paulo (USP)

Passionate about leveraging mathematical and computational techniques to tackle
complex problems and even participating in international competitions like ICPC and
IMC, with focus on solving such challenges. I’m particularly enthusiastic about
Algorithms (from areas ranging from Competitive Programming to Machine Learning),
proving their correctness, Formal Mathematics, Statistical Learning Theory and
Theoretical Computer Science.
